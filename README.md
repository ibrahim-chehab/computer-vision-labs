- `2-image_processing.ipynb`: Basic image processing techniques.
- `3-Morphological-Operations.ipynb`: Morphological operations on images.
- `4-edge_detection_filtering.ipynb`: Edge detection using filters.

### Lab 2: Image Alignment
- `align_images.py`: Aligning images for comparison and analysis.

### Lab 3: Feature Detection
- `1_corner_detection.ipynb`: Detecting corners in images.
- `2_edge_detection.ipynb`: Advanced edge detection methods.
- `3_grid_detection.ipynb`: Detecting grids and structures.
- `4_contour_detection.ipynb`: Contour detection and analysis.

### Lab 4: Object Detection
